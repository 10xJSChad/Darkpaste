# Darkpaste
Simple Pastebin alternative made for use by me & friends.

Darkpaste has support for public, unlisted, and private pastes. <br>
It does **NOT** support editing or deleting pastes as of now. <br>
There is no sign-up page despite being trivial to implement as I did not see a need for it.

Darkpaste is made using Flask & [AnaDB](https://github.com/10xJSChad/AnaDB) for login/paste storage
Use 'User Creation.py' to create new accounts. Login information is stored locally & not encrypted in any way.
