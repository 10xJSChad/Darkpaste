# Darkpaste
Simple Pastebin alternative made for use by me & friends.

Darkpaste has support for public, unlisted, and private pastes. <br>
Users can also edit or delete their pastes at any time.

The registration page can be enabled or disabled in Config.py
Make accounts with User Creation.py if registration is disabled.

Darkpaste is made using [Flask](https://github.com/pallets/flask) & [AnaDB](https://github.com/10xJSChad/AnaDB) for login/paste storage. Login information is stored locally & is md5 hashed and salted, this is not very secure but it's better than nothing. The salt can be found & modified in Config.py
